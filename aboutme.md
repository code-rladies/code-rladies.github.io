We are a local chapter of R-Ladies Global. Many of our meetings are based in Columbia, MO but we are focused on bringing together R-Ladies throughout Mid-Missouri. Our mission is to encourage data science and coding in Mid-Missouri for under-represented genders. 

While R is what brought us together, we aim to be an inclusive group, bringing together the multitude of coding skills throughout Mid-Missouri. Data science is a multidisciplinary activity; to share your ideas with the world and creating production-ready code often means bringing together people from a variety of disciplines and expertise in order to grow. 

### Code-RLadies Organizers

We have several organizers (you can see us on [our R-Ladies Mid-Mo Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-mid-mo/)), but we are continually looking for people who would like to get involved, present, and help make Code-RLadies MidMo even better! You can also email us at [rladiesmidmo@gmail.com](mailto:rladiesmidmo@gmail.com).
