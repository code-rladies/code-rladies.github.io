We are a local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://www.rladies.org), an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools. Our chapter's mission is to encourage data science and coding in Mid-Missouri for under-represented genders. 

Many of our meetings are based in Columbia, MO but we are focused on bringing together R-Ladies throughout Mid-Missouri. We welcome members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

### Code-RLadies Organizers

We have several organizers (you can see us on [our R-Ladies Mid-Mo Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-mid-mo/)), but we are continually looking for people who would like to get involved, present, and help make Code-RLadies MidMo even better! You can also email us at [rladiesmidmo@gmail.com](mailto:rladiesmidmo@gmail.com).

### We Seek Diversity in Programming, Experience, and Tools

While R is what brought us together, we aim to be an inclusive group, bringing together the multitude of coding skills throughout Mid-Missouri. Data science is a multidisciplinary activity; to share your ideas with the world and creating production-ready code often means bringing together people from a variety of disciplines and expertise in order to grow. 

### We Seek Diversity People and Identities

We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on the [R-Ladies Github account](https://github.com/rladies) and follow R-Ladies Global on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!
